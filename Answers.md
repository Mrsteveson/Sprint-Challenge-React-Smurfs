1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Client-side routing takes a user to different parts of the application without refreshing the page.
    It loads the entire website when first navigating to the page.

    Server-side routing is dependant on the URLs and refreshes the page whenever it is rerouted.
    It only loads the necessary portion of the web application, and therefore requires more frequent loading periods to continue to render the page as it is navigated through.
